## Functionalities of the Poll App

- [ ] Remaster docker configuration as it's not running as it should
- [ ] Restrict users to vote once per some time interval, e.g., once per 24 hours - can be achieved if we store the last voting time for a certain question and validate if it's outside the time frame
- [ ] Restrict/allow users to change their vote, probably once or twice per question
- [x] Allow only admin users to create/edit/delete polls
- [x] Restrict edit/delete of questions if already voted
- [x] Display a list of all polls
- [x] Display questions results in percentage
- [x] Authenticate users with Devise
- [x] Restrict more than one vote per question per user - if registered - the email is checked, if guest user - it's IP
- [x] Authorize users based on roles (admin, regular user)
- [ ] Send email notifications to users when new poll is created or is closed, as polls could be active in some certain timeframe; can send to users the results of the polls and when someone voted - can be achieved with Noticed 2 
- [ ] Implement search functionality for polls (maybe by category, brands or something of interest) and add pagination for poll listing - probably Kaminari would do the work
- [ ] Add comments to polls and maybe some file/image upload
- [ ] Like/dislike polls
- [ ] Share polls on social media
- [ ] Export poll results to CSV or any other format like PDF, XLSx
- [ ] Import poll data from CSV
- [x] Implement API endpoints for polls
- [ ] Add tests with Rspec; model, request, integration
- [ ] Optimize db queries, especially for the vote counting, maybe with counter cache
- [ ] Add user profile pages and better admin UI
- [ ] Implement user settings (change password, update email, etc.)
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add internationalization 
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring for error tracking
